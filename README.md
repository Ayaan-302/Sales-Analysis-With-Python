# Sales Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project showcases the use of Python for analyzing and visualizing sales data to uncover actionable insights. By leveraging libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we explore key trends, identify top-performing products, and analyze sales across different cities and months.

## Features
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Identify sales performance over time.
- **Top-Performing Products**: Highlight the most popular and profitable products.
- **Geographic Sales Analysis**: Analyze city-wise sales to uncover high-performing regions.
- **Visualization**: Use charts and graphs to make insights visually appealing and easy to understand.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
